# various simulations
All the simulations that I have implemented as part of ECE1180 - Computational Modeling & Simulation Engineering course.  
These simulations involve a high level of physics that follows a real-life patterns.  
Each simulation consists of the code for the simulation, its descriptions, and the verification using real-life values.   
For the visualization, VPython library has been used. For graphing, matplotlib has been used.  
  
### List of Simulations  
- A ball bouncing due to its elasticity  
- Newton's cannonball that shows how a certain launch velocity would enable the ball to fully orbit around the Earth  
- Real-life solar system (verified with datasets from NASA)  
- Crystal Lattice with KE/PE and damping using forward, backward, and trapezoid Euler equations  
- 1D/2D Synchrnous and Asynchrous Cellular Automata  
- Conway's Game of Life  
- Implementation of various Logic Gates in a form of a code, and making D-Latch with them  
- LTSpice simulation that works like a real-life circuit board  
- [Final] Wildfire simulation using Aynchronous Cellular Automata with States  

All the simulations are developed by Aiden Seo.
